      "cooking_time": "[Total cooking time in minutes]",
      "serving_size": "[Number of servings the recipe yields]",
      "description": "[Description of the meal, highlighting flavors and key features]",
      "ingredients": [
        "[Ingredient 1 (its quantity)]",
        "[Ingredient 2 (its quantity)]",
        "[Ingredient 3 (its quantity)]",
        "...other ingredients..."
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "[Step 1]",
        "[Step 2]",
        "[Step 3]",
        "...other steps..."
      ]
    },
    {
      "recipe_number": 2,
      "recipe_name": "[Creative name for the recipe]",
      "cooking_time": "[Total cooking time in minutes]",
      "serving_size": "[Number of servings the recipe yields]",
